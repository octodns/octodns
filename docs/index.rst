DNS as Code
===========

Tools for managing DNS across multiple providers
------------------------------------------------

In the vein of infrastructure as code octoDNS provides a set of tools &
patterns that make it easy to manage your DNS records across multiple
providers. The resulting config can live in a repository and be deployed just
like the rest of your code, maintaining a clear history and using your existing
review & workflow.

The architecture is pluggable and the tooling is flexible to make it applicable
to a wide variety of use-cases. Effort has been made to make adding new
providers as easy as possible. In the simple case that involves writing of a
single class and a couple hundred lines of code, most of which is translating
between the provider's schema and octoDNS's.

Processors

   * - Processor
     - Description
   * - `AcmeManagingProcessor`_
     - Useful when processes external to octoDNS are managing acme challenge DNS records, e.g. LetsEncrypt
   * - `AutoArpa`_
     - See :ref:`automatic-ptr-generation`
   * - `EnsureTrailingDots`_
     - Processor that ensures ALIAS, CNAME, DNAME, MX, NS, PTR, and SRVs have trailing dots
   * - `ExcludeRootNsChanges`_
     - Filter that errors or warns on planned root/APEX NS records changes.
   * - `IgnoreRootNsFilter`_
     - Filter that IGNORES root/APEX NS records and prevents octoDNS from trying to manage them (where supported.)
   * - `MetaProcessor`_
     - Adds a special meta record with timing, UUID, providers, and/or version to aid in debugging and monitoring.
   * - `NameAllowlistFilter`_
     - Filter that ONLY manages records that match specified naming patterns, all others will be ignored
   * - `NameRejectlistFilter`_
     - Filter that IGNORES records that match specified naming patterns, all others will be managed
   * - `ValueAllowlistFilter`_
     - Filter that ONLY manages records that match specified value patterns based on `rdata_text`, all others will be ignored
   * - `ValueRejectlistFilter`_
     - Filter that IGNORES records that match specified value patterns based on `rdata_text`, all others will be managed
   * - `OwnershipProcessor`_
     - Processor that implements ownership in octoDNS so that it can manage only the records in a zone in sources and will ignore all others.
   * - `SpfDnsLookupProcessor`_
     - Processor that checks SPF values for violations of DNS query limits
   * - `TtlRestrictionFilter`_
     - Processor that restricts the allow TTL values to a specified range or list of specific values
   * - `TypeAllowlistFilter`_
     - Filter that ONLY manages records of specified types, all others will be ignored
   * - `TypeRejectlistFilter`_
     - Filter that IGNORES records of specified types, all others will be managed
   * - `octodns-spf`_
     - SPF Value Management for octoDNS

Custom Sources and Providers
----------------------------

You can check out the source_ and provider_ directories to see what's currently
supported.  Sources act as a source of record information. AxfrSource and
TinyDnsFileSource are currently the only OSS sources, though we have several
others internally that are specific to our environment. These include something
to pull host data from gPanel_ and a similar provider that sources information
about our network gear to create both ``A`` & ``PTR`` records for their
interfaces. Things that might make good OSS sources might include an
``ElbSource`` that pulls information about `AWS Elastic Load Balancers`_ and
dynamically creates ``CNAME``s for them, or ``Ec2Source`` that pulls instance
information so that records can be created for hosts similar to how our
``GPanelProvider`` works.

.. _source: https://github.com/octodns/octodns/tree/main/octodns/source/
.. _provider: https://github.com/octodns/octodns/tree/main/octodns/provider/
.. _gPanel: https://githubengineering.com/githubs-metal-cloud/
.. _AWS Elastic Load Balancers: https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/

Most of the things included in octoDNS are providers, the obvious difference
being that they can serve as both sources and targets of data. We'd really like
to see this list grow over time so if you use an unsupported provider then PRs
are welcome. The existing providers should serve as reasonable examples. Those
that have no GeoDNS support are relatively straightforward. Unfortunately most
of the APIs involved to do GeoDNS style traffic management are complex and
somewhat inconsistent so adding support for that function would be nice, but is
optional and best done in a separate pass.

The ``class`` key in the providers config section can be used to point to
arbitrary classes in the python path so internal or 3rd party providers can
easily be included with no coordination beyond getting them into
``PYTHONPATH``, most likely installed into the virtualenv with octoDNS.
